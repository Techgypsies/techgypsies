<p>Kin and I have just returned from our trip to New York City. I think it was one of the best trips we&#8217;ve taken to The City, in no small part because we made sure to focus on seeing friends while in town. Too often when we travel for work &#8211; and this was a work-related trip as I was <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2016/09/22/pigeon">speaking at the Designs on eLearning conference</a> &#8211; we see little more than the conference venue and our hotel.</p>

<p>We had a list of things we wanted to do, and we did them all (except see <em>Hamilton</em>, but I don&#8217;t feel quite so bad about that since Lin-Manuel Miranda is no longer in the show). I ate fried chicken at Blue Smoke. Kin ate bagels and lox. We saw Jos√© and Alejandro and Tim and Sava and Jade. We walked along the High Line. We visited the NYPL and saw an exhibit on protest zines. We ate pizza twice. We traveled all the way up to 116th and all the way down to the Financial District. We wandered around the city &#8211; the weather was just perfect.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve created a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/147716978@N08">new account on Flickr</a> to host Tech Gypsies&#8217; photos. (I&#8217;ve done so since I think Drone Recovery will be on hiatus for a while, and I want to make sure that the photos and videos posted by the account stay focused on its mission.)</p>
