<p><strong>Kin Lane</strong> is known as the API Evangelist - not in the sense that he evangelizes a single API to developers, but insofar as he works to make everyone API aware. This involves understanding not just the technology, but the business and politics of APIs.</p>

<p><strong>Audrey Watters</strong> is writer who focuses on education technology - the relationship between politics, pedagogy, business, culture, and ed-tech. Although she was two chapters into her PhD dissertation, she decided to abandon academia, and she now happily fulfills the one job recommended to her by a junior high aptitude test: freelance writer.</p>
