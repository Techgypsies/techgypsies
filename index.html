<p>I&rsquo;ve been working in the technology space for over 20 years. &nbsp;I remember building my own relational databases, and generating stacks of floppy disks to distribute software to clients. &nbsp;After spending much of my career online, I strongly believe in the openness and distributed nature of the Internet, and that the World Wide Web will be the vehicle to deliver on the promises of technology. &nbsp;<br /><br />I have lived as a programmer, database administrator, architect, product developer, manager and executive, with experience in business development, sales and marketing--all while living with chronic entrepreneurialism. &nbsp;In this decade I&rsquo;ve rolled all that experience into a new persona, one that focuses exclusively on APIs--called the API Evangelist.<br /><br />I spend my days studying the business and politics of the API and telling stories from the space. &nbsp;I thrive on monitoring the API industry in real-time, but also feel looking back at the history, as well as tracking on new trends that are emerging.<br /><br />I&rsquo;m a full time evangelist, not for a single API, but for APIs in general. &nbsp;My focus is not just on developers, but helping the rest of the world understand the value and potential of APIs. &nbsp;<br /><br />You can follow my work on the business of APIs via <a href="http://apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a>, the politics of APIs via <a href="http://apievoice.com">apivoice.com</a> and my personal thoughts on <a href="http://kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a>. &nbsp;I encourage engagement via Disqus on my blogs and via Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@KinLanea>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; I often say. You can catch snippets of it, if you pay attention. I&rsquo;ve got a <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/cv.html">CV</a> if you&rsquo;re the type that cares about that sort of thing. There's a bunch of buttons to your right that you can click on for other social signals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a lit geek and a beer snob. I love tattoos and technology. I loathe mushy foods and romantic comedies. I&rsquo;m not ashamed to admit I like ABBA and dislike Tolkien. I am somewhat ashamed to admit I&rsquo;ve not finished Ulysses. I pick fights on the Internet. I'm still snarky offline, but I'm not always so tough. &nbsp;I was widowed 9 days after I turned 35. &nbsp;I have an 18 year old kid who makes my heart just explode with love and pride. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m a high school dropout and a PhD dropout. I have a cold hard stare that I like to imagine is much like Paddington Bear&rsquo;s and a smirk much like the Cheshire Cat&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I currently travel as much as I possibly can. &ldquo;Home,&rdquo; at least according to my driver&rsquo;s license, is Hermosa Beach, California.</p>
<p>Way back in junior high, I took an aptitude test that gave me a single career option: <a href="https://plus.google.com/108741250435676131889?rel=author">freelance writera>. &nbsp;I remember feeling rather panicky at the time, wondering how the hell I&rsquo;d manage to pull it off. But now I do. My stories have appeared on NPR/KQED's education technology blog <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org">MindShift</a>, in the data section of <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com">O&rsquo;Reilly Radar</a>, on<a href="http://insidehighered.com"> Inside Higher Ed</a>, in&nbsp;<a href="http://readwriteweb.com">ReadWriteWeb</a>, in the <a href="http://www.thedigitalshift.com/author/awatters/">School Library Journal</a>, and in the <a href="http://edutopia.org">Edutopia's</a> blog (among other places).</p>
<p>And of course, I write here and on <a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>.<br /><br />In my spare time, I read, rabble-rouse, drink beer, and prepare for the zombie apocalypse. Because you never know what the hell's gonna happen&hellip;</p>
